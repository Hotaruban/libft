# libft

This is my first project as (cadet) in 42 Bangkok.

I test with 3 tester before submit

  Tripouille: https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester
  
  War-machine: https://github.com/0x050f/libft-war-machine
  
  Unit: https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test
  
in this order.

I suggest you to review your code sometimes after you did an other project to improve your code or to be sure some mistake pass Moulinette and Evaluation.
