# libft

This version is totaly different than the vesion who pass the commun core of 42.
It is my version with get_next_line (bonus) and with some extra function.
I still modifiy some part to make it better and to improve comment.

This is my first project as (cadet) in 42 Bangkok.

I test with 3 tester before submit

  Tripouille: https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester
  
  War-machine: https://github.com/0x050f/libft-war-machine
  
  Unit: https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test
  
in this order.

I suggest you to review your code sometimes after you did an other project to improve your code or to be sure some mistake pass Moulinette and Evaluation.
